# MATLAB Transfer Function Constants Calculator
Creator: Ben Mighall

This program is a MATLAB script that calculates the constants A, B and C with Beta and Zeta as parameters in a sum of transfer functions derived from the transfer function of the standard second order system with an additional pole. The transfer functions are A multiplied by the form of a standard second order system, B multiplied by the form of a standard first order system, and C multiplied by whatever is left over. 

The program has two components: Constant_Calculate20SwP, the function that actually calculates the constants; and ElE431ICE12Q1B, which is simply an implementation of the function to demonstrate its functionality. (Yes, I know both titles are kind of hard to read; I've gotten better at that since I made this program about a year and a half ago.)

This MATLAB program was written for University of Mississippi class El E 431 (Theory of Control Systems).
